A first project when learning Python...

Use of Python with SQLite to retrieve, store and 
compare book prices from multiple sellers, by scraping websites.

Details of solution:
website_html_provider.py
    Encapsulates the request and conversion to BeautifulSoup

scrape_seller1.py, scrape_seller2.py,  scrape_seller1.py 
    A file per seller (website).
    Each makes use of website_html_provider.py
    Each reads the price from the specific location that the seller uses wthin the website_html_provider

database_layer.py
    Abstracts the database implementation from the rest of the solution.
    Provides methods to access and write data. 

compare_prices.py
    Contains the logic of the application.
    Asks the user to select a book.
    Scrapes the prices from each seller and stores them (in the database).
    Reads the values from the database.
    Presents the user with details of the seller offering the best price.    

Do not srcape websites or use this code; this is merely an example of what is possible.
